GTNT SKRIPT
-


Explanation:
When a player runs the /gtnt command, 100 TNT blocks will spawn around them.
The TNT will spawn in a random position within a 10-block radius horizontally (_x and _z) and up to 2 blocks vertically (_y).
The TNT is "primed," meaning it will explode after the usual fuse time.
This script generates a chaotic explosion with 100 TNT blocks! Feel free to adjust the radius or number of TNT blocks if needed.

            set {_y} to random integer between -2 and 2
            set {_z} to random integer between -10 and 10
            set {_location} to location of player
            add {_x} to x-coordinate of {_location}
            add {_y} to y-coordinate of {_location}
            add {_z} to z-coordinate of {_location}
