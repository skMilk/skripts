Chat management script:

This chat management Skript provides a robust system for managing player interactions in the chat, including muting players, locking and unlocking the chat, clearing messages, and filtering out inappropriate language through a blacklist. By using this Skript, server admins can maintain a more controlled and respectful chat environment.

Chat Event Handling:


Muting:
If a muted player attempts to send a message, the message is canceled, and the player is informed that they cannot send messages.
Locking:
If the chat is locked, any player attempting to send a message will have their message canceled and will receive a notification that the chat is locked.
Blacklist Checking:
When a player sends a message, the Skript checks if it contains any words from the blacklist.
If a blacklisted word is found, the message is canceled, and the player receives a notification indicating which word triggered the block.
