Clear Command:
-


Explanation:
When a player runs the /clear command, a message is sent to them to indicate that placed blocks are being cleared.
The script loops through all blocks within a 1000-block radius around the player.
If a block is not air and was placed by a player, it sets that block to air, effectively removing it.
Blocks that were not placed by players (like natural terrain) will remain unchanged.
Note:
To check if a block is placed by a player, you might need an additional plugin or Skript addon that provides this functionality, as the basic Skript language does not include built-in functionality for determining block ownership. If you don't have such a system, consider using a different approach, like clearing specific types of blocks (e.g., only certain types of blocks like dirt, stone, etc.) instead.
Make sure you have the appropriate permissions set up, or feel free to remove the permission line if you want the command to be available to all players!

Skript:

command /clear:
    permission: skript.clear
    trigger:
        send "&cClearing all placed blocks in a 1000 block radius!" to player
        loop all blocks in radius 1000 around player:
            if loop-block is not air:
                if loop-block is placed by a player:
                    set loop-block to air
